* This is an example code for the algorithm described in

Hang Zhou, Kejiang Chen, Weiming Zhang, Zhenxing Qian, and Nenghai Yu.
"Targeted Attack and Security Enhancement on Texture Synthesis Based Steganography", JVCIR 2018.

* To run the example code: 
1. Put source texture images in the "data" directory;
2. Start from main_para_estimate.m. for parameter estimation.
3. Start from main_fea_extract.m for feature extraction.
