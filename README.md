Introduction
--
This work is published on Journal of Visual Communication and Image Representation (JVCIR), 2018.

We describe an effective and efficient strategy building steganography detector for patch synthesis based steganography, one case of which is reversible texture synthesis based steganography method proposed by [Wu et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6957552/) (2015).
